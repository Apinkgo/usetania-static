After two years of working and maintaining Tania, we realize that not everybody has the skills to compile Tania from the source--we provided the pre-compiled version for Windows and Linux as the solution. Some users also ask us to help them deploy Tania on their server. Hence, we get an idea to create the SaaS version. You don't need to think about deployment nor maintaining the infrastructure and version update. What you only need is focusing on your farm business. Sounds good, ain't?

To make the idea happen, we are planning a crowdfunding campaign on [**Indiegogo**](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tania/coming_soon) to cover the development cost of the SaaS and add new features of Tania. For this campaign, we are aiming **10,000â‚¬** (around US$11,300).

The new features that we're going to develop are the IoT hub and the crops planning. Those are the most requested features from the community. Thanks for you who have filled our feedback form (if you haven't filled it yet, please, do fill it [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiYmQYhShVSPMKZC1tV_r0gsLgOpgeHXgw2jkDcuK-oiUQ3w/viewform?usp=sf_link)).

Lastly, don't worry, Tania will remain open source as it is now. Please, share our upcoming [Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tania/coming_soon) to your social media and tell the world about Tania project.
