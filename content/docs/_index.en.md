**Tania** is a free and open source farm management software, based on Go, Vue.JS, and SQLite. We developed it since November 2016 because we couldn't find any farm management system that suits with our needs, where we have to connect various sensors and automators for our home backyard garden, and manage it while we are on-the-go.

If you are a farmer or grower, you can manage your farm easily with Tania. We know that it's still a small project. Therefore, we are very open if you want to collaborate with us and make this project bigger.
