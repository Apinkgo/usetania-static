	</p>
</div>

<div class="mt48 pb0">
	<h4 class="bolder">Create first water reservoir</h4>	
	<p>
		Next, you will define the source of water on your farm. You can select the <code>Tap/Well</code> if you have infinite water source, or you can select <code>Water tank/Cistern</code> if you have limited water source. Then you can click <code>Continue</code>.

<div class="mt48 pb0">
