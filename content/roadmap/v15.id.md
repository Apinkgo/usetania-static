Tania current [stable version is 1.5.1](https://github.com/Tanibox/tania-core) was released in 2018. It is a total rewrite of the initial Tania that is written in PHP (Symfony framework). Version 1.5.1 uses Go lang and we will use it for the later version. We change the language because we want to make Tania easy to install in any machine--on the cloud environment, on the NAS (Network Attached Storage), or even on the small device like Raspberry Pi. Go lang can cater to that requirement.

The 1.5.1 is a good start, but we have more works to do to make Tania the best companion for farmers and growers.

Our plans will evolve over time based on customer feedbacks and market opportunities. If you have feedback about what you think we should be working on, please get in touch with us on [Telegram](https://t.me/usetania). We appreciate any feedback and contributions from the community.
