      <description>After two years of working and maintaining Tania, we realize that not everybody has the skills to compile Tania from the source&amp;ndash;we provided the pre-compiled version for Windows and Linux as the solution. Some users also ask us to help them deploy Tania on their server. Hence, we get an idea to create the SaaS version. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to think about deployment nor maintaining the infrastructure and version update. What you only need is focusing on your farm business.</description>

There are some key skills and attributes to be a successful farmer, that are more important than others. If you&amp;rsquo;re considering farming as your business, I think you should &amp;ldquo;invest&amp;rdquo; in these skills.
1. Organisational Skills If you never manage your checkbook balance, you&amp;rsquo;ll be easier to get a crazy shock by your unorganised system. Farmers must keep all kinds of records accurately, regularly.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Succesful Farmer</title>

      <description>Since running Tanibox, I have met many farmers who are pretty successful in running their farming businesses. By having deep conversations with them, it&amp;rsquo;s not that they know how to grow pretty vegetables. It&amp;rsquo;s that these farmers have a deep understanding of how a business should work.
I&amp;rsquo;ve come to this conclusion.
 If you can&amp;rsquo;t make a living by farming, then you&amp;rsquo;re NOT a great farmer. You might be a great grower, but you’re not a good farmer nor a successful one.</description>

      <description>Smart farming is an idea to cultivate crops with a combination of the latest technology and data analysis. The objective of it is to get more yields with few bad impacts on the environment than the conventional farming method.
How can we start doing smart farming? Is it expensive? These are common questions. We can start small without buying expensive equipment.
The first step is collecting data. We can start to gather data by using a simple tool like a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.</description>

      <description>The overall architecture of Tania is built so it doesn’t rely on particular storage, protocol, or serialization format. Because it needs to be deployed to a different environment like Raspberry Pi, NAS QNAP, or the cloud like AWS. We name the Tania architecture as Modular Monolith as each domain share nothing.
